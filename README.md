# RTD OEM System Builder: 
![RTD Builder Screenshot](Media_files/Scr2.png?raw=true "Executing the Script")

The RTD OEM System builder is intended to facilitate adding optional software to a vanilla install of Ubuntu or Debian based distribution. The bootstrap script will identify Linux/Mac/BSD/windows versions and execute those configurations scripts if they are defined. The non Linux references are essentially empty in the bootstrap script, since most of the items intended for windows and Mac are proprietary and may not be distributed. 

If a graphical environment is not detected, the RTD OEM System Builder will interpret this as it is being rin on a server without a graphical environment and will offer to setup the productivity tools for that environment.

As promised, the rtd-me.sh.cmd script will run under windows as well. Simply download it and double click on it. Please note that at this time the windows functionality i less extensive. However, the script will optimize Windows by removeing bloatware and turning off services that most do not use to enhance both performance ad security.

# RTD-Build

Here you will find some scripts for windows and Linux that I have created and/or modified over the years. I have added them here simply to share in the hopes that someone will find something useful. 

It would make me happy if any modification are shared back.
