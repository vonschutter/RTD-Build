# RTD OEM System Builder: 
The RTD System builder is intended to facilitate adding optional software to a vanilla install of Ubuntu or Debian based distribution. The bootstrap script will identify windows versions and execute those configurations scripts as well... these are empty here though since most of the items intended for windows are proprietary and may not be distributed. 

If a graphical environment is not detected, the RTD OEM System Builder will interpret this as it is being rin on a server without a graphical environment and will offer to setup the productivity tools for that environment.

# RTD-Build

Here you will find some scripts for windows and Linux that I have created and/or modified over the years. I have added them here simply to share in the hopes that someone will find something useful. 

It would make me happy if any modification are shared back.
