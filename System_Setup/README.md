# RTD OEM System Builder:
![RTD Builder Screenshot](Media_files/Scr9.png?raw=true "Executing the Script")

The RTD System builder is intended to facilitate adding optional software to a vanilla install of Ubuntu or Debian based distribution. The bootstrap script will identify windows versions and execute those configurations scripts as well... these are empty here though since most of the items intended for windows are proprietary and may not be distributed.
