# RTD OEM System Builder:
![RTD Builder Screenshot](Media_files/Scr9.png?raw=true "Executing the Script")

The RTD System builder is intended to facilitate adding, optional and highly usefull, software to a vanilla install of Ubuntu or Debian based distribution automatically. 
´´´
However, the RTD System Builder is known to work with other distributions as well. NOTE: software titles may be named slightly differently in some versions of Linux and may therefore not install since they are not found. For this reason, more emphasis is placed on "snap" apps where possible to allow universal installs. 
´´´
The bootstrap (rtd-me.sh.cmd) script will identify the running OS versions and execute teh relevant scripts to install software and/or configuration changes.
