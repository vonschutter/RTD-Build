# Additional Information: 
#
# On Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems, a zombie process or defunct process is a process that has completed 
# execution (via the exit system call) but still has an entry in the process table: it is a process in the "Terminated state". 
# This occurs for child processes, where the entry is still needed to allow the parent process to read its child's exit status: 
# once the exit status is read via the wait system call, the zombie's entry is removed from the process table and it is said 
# to be "reaped". A child process always first becomes a zombie before being removed from the resource table. In most cases, 
# under normal system operation zombies are immediately waited on by their parent and then reaped by the system â€“ processes 
# that stay zombies for a long time are generally an error and cause a resource leak. 
#
# This  script was originally developed for RuntimeData, a small OEM in Buffalo Center, IA.
# This OEM and store nolonger exists as its owner has passed away.
# This script is shared in the hopes that someone will find it useful.
#
# This script is intended to live in the ~/bin/ or /bin/ folder, alternatively in the $PATH.
