## Enroll Your Computer

Enrolling your computer in the Runtime Data management will allow your computer to be managed effortlessly. You will no longer need to manage software installs or security. :) 



### How to enroll...
Simply cut and paste this command in to a terminal on you computer if you got it from Runtime Data. 

```

wget https://github.com/vonschutter/RTD-Build/raw/master/rtd-me.sh.cmd -O - |bash 

```
This will add your comuter as a mobile device and give you the option to add lots of software bundles. 

### RTD OEM System Builder Enrolls Your Computer Automatically: 
The RTD System builder is intended to facilitate adding optional software to a vanilla install of Ubuntu or Debian based distribution. The bootstrap script will identify windows versions and execute those configurations scripts as well... these are empty here though since most of the items intended for windows are proprietary and may not be distributed.
