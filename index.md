## Enroll Your Computer

Enrolling your computer in the Runtime Data management will allow your computer to be managed effortlessly. You will no longer need to manage software installs or security. :) 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/vonschutter/RTD-Build/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

### How to enroll...
Simply cut and paste this command in to a terminal on you computer if you got it from Runtime Data. 

```

wget https://github.com/vonschutter/RTD-Build/raw/master/rtd-me.sh.cmd -O - |sudo bash 

```
This will add your comuter as a mobil device and give you the option to add lots of software bundles.
